#App.js - client code
This application is a web-based form submission system built with React for enrolling patients with their family doctor. It allows users to fill out multiple sections of a form, each representing different aspects of patient enrollment, and submit the form data to the server for processing. Here's a breakdown of the features and sections of the application:

Form Sections: The form is divided into multiple sections, each representing a different aspect of patient enrollment. Users can navigate through these sections using the "Next Section" button.
Form Validation: Input fields in the form are validated to ensure that users provide accurate information. Fields may have specific patterns and requirements to meet before submission.
Submission: Users can submit each section of the form individually. Upon submission, the form data is sent to the server via a POST request for processing.
Signature and Date: The final section of the form requires users to provide their signature and the date, which are essential for completing the enrollment process.
PDF Generation: After the final submission, the server generates a PDF document containing the submitted form data. This PDF is displayed to the user for review and can be downloaded for record-keeping purposes.
Server-Side Handling: The server-side code handles form submissions, stores data, generates PDF documents, and manages CORS to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.
Error Handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to manage server errors, network issues, and form validation errors.
User Feedback: Users receive feedback messages indicating successful form submissions or any encountered errors during the process.
Overall, this application provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for enrolling patients with their family doctors, streamlining the enrollment process and ensuring accurate record-keeping.


#server.js - server code

This server-side code, built with Node.js and Express, handles form submissions and generates PDF documents based on the submitted form data. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

Middleware Setup: The server uses Express middleware, including CORS for cross-origin resource sharing and JSON parsing for handling incoming requests.
Database Connection: It connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, allowing storage and retrieval of form data.
Form Data Schema and Model: A Mongoose schema and model are defined to structure and interact with the form data stored in the MongoDB database.
PDF Generation Endpoint: The /generate-pdf endpoint receives a POST request with form data, fetches the data from the database, and populates a PDF template with the retrieved data.
PDF Generation Process: PDF generation involves loading a template PDF, extracting text fields from the template, updating the text content with the form data, and serializing the modified PDF to a buffer.
Error Handling: The server includes error handling to manage exceptions during PDF generation and database operations.
Server Initialization: The server listens on the specified port (either from the environment variable or port 5000) and serves requests accordingly.
Overall, this server provides essential functionality for handling form submissions and generating PDF documents dynamically based on the submitted data, contributing to a robust form submission system.
